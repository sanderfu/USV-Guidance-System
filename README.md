# USV Gudiance System
The USV Guidance System is a collection of ROS Noetic packages developed for the master thesis <em>Path and Motion Planning for Unmanned Surface Vehicles subject to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea</em> by Sander Furre.



## Installation:
The guidance system includes a devcontainer environment for use with Docker in Visual Studio Code. Opening the contrainer will fetch and build all necessary dependencies.
> :warning: **The devcontainer environment is still in development**: Proceed with persistence!

## Running the Guidance System
The gudiance system package collection includes a several launch configurations. Note that appropriate Electrionic Navigational Charts (ENCs) must be obtained to utilize these launch files and the system in general. For the United states coastline, charts can easily be obtained from **[NOAA](https://charts.noaa.gov/InteractiveCatalog/nrnc.shtml)**. For the Norwegian Coastline, charts are not openly available. It is advised to contact the Norwegian Mapping Authority if one is to do research requiring ENCs of this area.
