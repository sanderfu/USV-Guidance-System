# USV Guidance System
The USV Guidance System is a collection of ROS Noetic packages developed for the master thesis <em>Path and Motion Planning for Unmanned Surface Vehicles subject to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea</em> by Sander Furre.



## Installation:
The guidance system includes a devcontainer environment used with Docker in Visual Studio Code. Opening the container and running install_dependencies.sh in <em>scripts</em> with sudo privilege will fetch and build all dependencies.
> :warning: **The devcontainer environment is still in development**: Proceed with persistence!

## Running the Guidance System
The guidance system package collection includes several launch configurations. Appropriate Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) must be obtained to utilize these launch files and the system. For the United States coastline, charts can easily be obtained from **[NOAA](https://charts.noaa.gov/InteractiveCatalog/nrnc.shtml)**. For the Norwegian Coastline, charts are not openly available. It is advised to contact the Norwegian Mapping Authority if one is to do research requiring ENCs of this area.
